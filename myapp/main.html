            <p><b>Foundation History</b>
                <br />
                The Hüsnü M. Özyeğin Foundation began its efforts to establish Özyeğin University in the fall of 2005.
                The foundation for Özyeğin University entailed comprehensive surveys conducted with more than 500
                subjects including businessmen, faculty members, and university and high school students, in addition to
                a study on "Developing Sectors and Professions in Turkey and in the World". Based on the results of
                these studies, ARAMA Consulting began the designing process. The University’s fundamental values and
                vision were discussed and identified in collaboration with all of the stakeholders. Özyeğin University
                shaped its vision through a series of workshops. More than 300 participants attended these workshops,
                including businessmen, faculty members, university students, and new graduates.
                <br />
                In line with its collectively-shaped vision, Özyeğin University was officially established on May 18,
                2007 to serve as a unique university that would contribute to social development through its modern
                education system, innovative structure integrated with life, academic approach intertwined with sectors,
                and academic programs tailored accordingly.
                <br />
                Özyeğin University welcomed its first students on its Altunizade Campus in September 2008, and opened
                the doors of its Çekmeköy Campus in September 2011.
            </p>
